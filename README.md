# Myeongsoo Kim â€” Personal Website & Blog

Welcome to my personal website and blog.

I'm an Applied Scientist at Amazon, working on LLM-powered developer tools, agentic workflows, prompt engineering, and evaluation pipelines. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, and have published research at top software engineering conferences including ICSE, FSE, ASE, and ISSTA.

ðŸ§  **What you'll find here**:
- Technical blog posts on building LLM systems, developer agents, and real-world prompt strategies  
- Learning notes and reflections on machine learning theory, programming languages, and core CS concepts

This site serves as both a **portfolio** and a **learning journal** â€” a space to reflect, document, and share ideas as I grow.
